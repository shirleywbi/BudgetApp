*********************************************************************
Goal: To create a budget tracker to input your income and expenses

How to run: Program can be run in the ui package, main class

Possible Capabilities (TBD):
- inputting your income and expenses
- categorizing your expenses
- print report to indicate:
	- total income
	- total money spent
	- breakdown of expenses

*********************************************************************
Stage 1: To create a budget tracker to produce an income and expenses

1. Create ui package > main class to start the project.
2. Create 2 methods: 
   (1) to print the income
   (2) to print the expenses

*********************************************************************
Stage 2: User Interaction

1. Insert interaction loop:

Main interaction screen:

"What would you like to do:"
[1] add income
[2] add expense
[3] show report

If user types in "1", they will be asked "Enter your income:". The integer would be saved. It will print income so far.
If user types in "2", they will be asked the following:
	"Enter name of expense:"
	"Cost:"
	The expense and cost will be saved.
	Print (name of expense, cost).
If user types in "3", show balance of income, total expenses, and list of expenses.

- Pass a parameter
- Use a local variable
- Return a value and use it
- Use a condition, and a loop
- Make a call graph from your main method
- Draw the flowchart for a method with a condition or a loop
- Use the debugger
